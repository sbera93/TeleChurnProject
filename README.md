# TeleChurnProject
Project Description: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Objective
The project aims to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry using real-world data. The primary goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn, visualize trends, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Dataset


The analysis is based on the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv dataset, which contains customer demographic information, service subscriptions, tenure, payment methods, and billing details. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy in analysis.

Key Steps in the Project

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


Handling missing values in TotalCharges.
Encoding categorical variables for better analysis.
Identifying and addressing outliers in MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Analyzing churn rates across different customer segments.
Identifying correlations between contract types, payment methods, tenure, and churn.
Visualizing churn trends over time and understanding service usage patterns.

Recommendations


Develop strategies to improve customer retention.
Identify high-risk customer segments for targeted interventions.
Enhance service offerings and pricing structures based on customer needs.

Tools & Technologies Used


Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
Data visualization techniques for trend identification


This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior, helping telecom companies design better retention strategies and reduce revenue loss due to churn.
